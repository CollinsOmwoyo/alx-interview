# Core Concepts
Lists: Manage nested lists for keys and boxes.

Graph Theory: Model boxes as nodes and keys as directed edges.

DFS/Stacks: Traverse boxes using depth-first search (DFS) and a stack.

Sets: Track visited boxes efficiently.

Recursion: Alternate approach for traversal logic.

Complexity: Focus on optimizing time and space (Big O).
